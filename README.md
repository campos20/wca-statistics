# wca-statistics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/campos20/wca-statistics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/campos20/wca-statistics)

This repository is meant to provide statistics for the WCA Statistics [group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/439995439706174). This project is being deprecated and it will be replaced with the [official](https://github.com/thewca/statistics) one.

You can check the statistics [here](https://campos20.github.io/wca-statistics/).

## Getting started

- `git clone https://github.com/thewca/statistics.git`
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- `./run.sh`
- Page layout requires [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and some statistics needs [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/). Currently, they are accessed using [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). If you want to build this locally, make sure you have internet connection or make the appropriate changes.
- View [wiki](https://github.com/campos20/wca-statistics/wiki/How-to-add-a-new-statistic) about how to add a new stat.
