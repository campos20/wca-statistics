# wca-statistics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/campos20/wca-statistics.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/campos20/wca-statistics)

This repository is meant to provide statistics for the WCA Statistics [group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/439995439706174). It's also my repo to study data science with Python.

You can check the statitics [here](https://campos20.github.io/wca-statistics/).

## Getting started

- Download this repo and execute `./run.sh`. You'll need python3 and some packages like [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). You'll be asked to download the WCA export. Some statistics can take a time to run.
- To install numpy, run `pip install numpy`. Run `pip3 install pandas` for pandas.
- View wiki about how to add a new stat.
